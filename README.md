This project was developed in spare time, during the university course [Organization theory and design](http://www-4.unipv.it/offertaformativa/portale/corso.php?lingua=1&idAttivitaFormativa=342405&modulo=0&anno=2020/2021)
, in the time between 21/03/2015 and 03/04/2015.

The purpose was to create a GUI to prepare for the tests during the course, having the questions of each chapter
provided sequentially or shuffled, with the count of correct, blank and wrong answers at the end, in addition of correct
answers.

The documentation [Guida.pdf](./Guida.pdf) explain also how to create new test cases and expand the program

It was written with Java 8, but it still works with Java 17.
